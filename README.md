# iTrans-Wearable-Glove
We developed iTrans, a smart glove with flex sensors, a microcontroller, and Bluetooth, enabling speech-disabled individuals to communicate via finger movements. The glove translates gestures into data, transmitting it to a connected device for real-time communication, enhancing the quality of life for users.
